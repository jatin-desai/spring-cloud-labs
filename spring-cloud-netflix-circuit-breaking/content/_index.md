In this workshop, we will use [Spring Cloud Netflix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/) to

* Protect your application (`greeting-hystrix`) from failures or latency with the circuit breaking pattern
* Publish circuit-breaking metrics from your application (`greeting-hystrix`)
* Consume metric streams with the `hystrix-dashboard`
